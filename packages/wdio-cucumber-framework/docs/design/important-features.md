# Important features to test

Selecting features and scenarios to test the cucumber-wdio reporter integration requires analysing the potential combinations of cucumber features which can produce different reported output. Features which merely test the binding of gherkin features to the underlying step definitions are not relevant for this purpose. The list identified below highlights the combinations which seem to merit testing with report integration.

## Basic reporting requirements

This section represents the basics for features and steps which need to be reported.

| Basic thing                               | test considerations (other than basic pass/fail reporting)                         |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature                                   | ???                                      |
| Given (or And or But)                     |                                                                                    |
| When (or And or But) steps                |                                                                                    |
| Then (or And or But) steps                |                                                                                    |
| Background steps                          | reported as part of each scenario                                                  |
| Scenario (or Scenario Outline or Example) |                                                                                    |
| Examples (or Combinations)                | For pass/fail somehow need to represent both Example and the Scenario line numbers |

### Basic questions

- [ ] 1. Are features reported through wdio somehow?

### Questions based on cucumber-js

- [ ] 1. Do cucumber background steps run before or after wdio hooks? (note that they run _before_ cucumber hooks) (source: background.feature)

    _Answer pending_

- [x] 2. Is it correct to assume that there is no --exit functionality or that wdio replaces it? (source: exit.feature)

    This will not be supported (@christian-bromann, https://github.com/webdriverio/v5/issues/82#issuecomment-403831128)

- [x] 3. Is it correct to assume that there is no --fail-fast functionality or that wdio replaces it? (source: fail_fast.feature)

    This will not be supported (see https://github.com/webdriverio/v5/issues/82#issuecomment-403831305)

- [x] 4. Does wdio support multiple languages like cucumber? (source: language.feature)

    "I think it does by applying certain cucumberOpts in the wdio config." (@christian-bromann,  https://github.com/webdriverio/v5/issues/82#issue-339135139)

- [x] 5. Do wdio rerun semantics replace/invalidate the cucumber ones? (source: rerun_formatter.feature)

    "This is also up to the Cucumber framework. WDIO doesn't do anything specific like this." (@christian-bromann,  https://github.com/webdriverio/v5/issues/82#issue-339135139)

- [x] 6. How does the wdio rerun functionality work with the cucumber rerun functionality (reporting)? (source: step_wrapper_with_options.feature)

    We will not do anything specific to work with the cucumber "rerun" functionality (see https://github.com/webdriverio/v5/issues/82#issue-339135139)

- [ ] 7. Is strict mode useable with wdio? (source: strict_mode.feature)

    _Answer pending_

- [x] 8. Is the high-level summary from cucumber relevant when using wdio? (source: summary_formatter.feature)

    "I think yes." (@christian-bromann,  https://github.com/webdriverio/v5/issues/82#issue-339135139)

- [x] 9. Is there any special reporting needed for tags functionality? (source: tagged_hooks.feature)

    "Tags aren't really working with the current integration which I would love to change. Such reporting would
need to be added." (@christian-bromann,  https://github.com/webdriverio/v5/issues/82#issue-339135139)

- [x] 10. Do we need to cope with errors invoking cucumber (e.g. invalid world parameters) ? (source: world_parameters.feature)

    "Yes." (@christian-bromann,  https://github.com/webdriverio/v5/issues/82#issue-339135139)
